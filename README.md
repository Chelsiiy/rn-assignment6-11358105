In this project , i will be creating a mock up of a shopping app with a functional search bar for items available .
I will also be making a cart where the customer can put in all their desired orders, this cart page will also give customers the opportunity to remove orders they no longer want.
I will be using the Async  is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.
I will also be using the file system . It allows developers to organize their code into different files and folders, making it easier to manage and maintain. 
I will also Secure store which  provides a way to encrypt and securely store keyâ€“value pairs locally on the device.
